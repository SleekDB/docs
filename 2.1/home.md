# SleekDB - A NoSQL Database made using PHP

SleekDB is a simple NoSQL database implemented in PHP without third-party dependencies that store data in plain JSON files.

It is not designed to handle heavy-load IO operations, it is designed to have a simple solution where all we need a database for is managing a few gigabytes of data. You can think of it as a database for low to medium operation loads.

## 😎 Manage Static Data With Ease

SleekDB works great as the database engine for low to medium traffic websites.

## 📝 Your Dynamic Website Become Static

SleekDB will cache all query data by default, in a way that would make any dynamic site as fast as static sites.

## 🗄 Flat File Database

SleekDB is also a flat file database, but instead of a single file it stores data in multiple JSON files. That allows it to have a better concurrency support comparing to a FlatFile database system. SleekDB can be compared with other flat file database systems because the final query output will be cached and later reused from a single file instead of traversing all the available files. So, it's a PHP flat file database as well.

## 🥳 You Are Not Alone!

SleekDB is being used with many websites and applications which are in production. The core team consists of two developer who are actively contributing to the development of SleekDB Database.
