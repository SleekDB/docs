# 🎉 Release Notes

## 📢 Optimizations, new query methods and more control

SleekDB 2.0 comes with so many important optimizations and other features that make it faster and more mature. This is the recommended SleekDB release version for new projects, and if you are using an older version consider upgrading as soon as possible.

### Changes from 2.0 to 2.1

- # ⚙️ New Configuration
With the new `primary_key` configuration you can now change the _id key name to everything you want.

### Changes from 1.5 to 2.0

- # 🔎 Improving document discovery process

  Added better file locking support with reduced nested loops for finding documents. Added methods that can be used to easily find a document without searching for entire available JSON files of a store.

- # Support for PHP >= 7.0

  The support of PHP 5 is dropped to provide more modern features.

- # ✨ New query methods

  - `first()`
  - `exists()`
  - `select()`
  - `except()`
  - `distinct()`
  - `join()`
  - `findAll()`
  - `findById()`
  - `findBy()`
  - `findOneBy()`
  - `updateBy()`
  - `deleteBy()`
  - `deleteById()`

- # Improved Code Quality

  We isolated most of the existing logics into different classes to make the codebase easy to understand and easy to maintain.

- # Unit Testing

  There was some concern among developers as it was lacking UNIT Testing, now its added!

- # SleekDB class now deprecated

  We beliefe that downwards compatibility is very important.
  
  That's why we always try our best to keep SleekDB as downwards compatible as possible and avoid breaking changes.
  
  Unfortunatelly we had to refactor and rewrite the whole SleekDB project to make it future proof and keep it maintainable. As a consequence the SleekDB class is now deprecated with version 2.0 and will be removed with version 3.0.

  ### A new era for SleekDB begins!

- # Better Caching Solution

  Data caching has been improved significantly.

  - Add custom expiry of a cache file with lifetime.
  - Ability of query specific caching rules.
