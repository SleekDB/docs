# Features

## Installing SleekDB

- # Lightweight, faster

  Stores data in plain-text utilizing JSON format, no binary conversion needed to store or fetch the data. Default query cache layer.

- # Schema free data storage

  SleekDB does not require any schema, so you can insert any types of data you want.

- # Query on nested properties

  As it supports schema free data, so you can filter and use conditions on nested properties of the JSON documents!

  If you write this where clause:

  ```php
  where( 'post.author.role', '=', 'admin' )
  ```

  SleekDB will look for data at:

  ```json
  {
    "post": {
      "author": {
        "role": "admin"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- # Dependency free, only needs PHP to run

  Supports PHP 7+. Requires no third-party plugins or software.

- # Default caching layer

  SleekDB will serve data from cache by default and regenerate cache automatically! Query results will be cached and later reused from a single file instead of traversing all the available files.

- # Rich Conditions and Filters

  Use multiple conditional comparisons, text search, sorting on multiple properties and nested properties. Some useful methods are:

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">
          <ul>
            <li>where</li>
            <li>orWhere</li>
            <li>select</li>
            <li>except</li>
            <li>in</li>
            <li>notIn</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td valign="top">
          <ul>
            <li>join</li>
            <li>like</li>
            <li>sort</li>
            <li>skip</li>
            <li>orderBy</li>
            <li>update</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td valign="top">
          <ul>
            <li>limit</li>
            <li>search</li>
            <li>distinct</li>
            <li>exists</li>
            <li>first</li>
            <li>delete</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
