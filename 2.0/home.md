# SleekDB - A NoSQL Database made using PHP

SleekDB is a simple NoSQL database implementation using pure PHP that store data in plain JSON files.

It is not designed to handle heavy-load IO operations, it is designed to have a simple solution where all we need a database for managing few gigabytes of data. You can think of it as a database for static websites.
