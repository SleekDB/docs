# ðŸŽ‰ Release Notes

## ðŸ“¢ Optimizations, new query methods and more control

SleekDB 2.0 comes with so many important optimizations and with other features that makes it faster and more mature. This is a recommended release if you are using an older version of SleekDB.

### Breaking changes from 1.5 to 2.0

- # Improving document discovery process

  Added better file locking support with reduced nested loops for finding documents. Added methods that can be used to easily find a document without searching for entire available JSON files of a store.

- # Added new query methods

  - `first()`
  - `exists()`
  - `select()`
  - `except()`
  - `distinct()`
  - `join()`

- # Improved Code Quality

  We isolated most of the existing logics into different classes to make the codebase easy to understand and easy to maintain.

- # Unit Testing

  There was some concern among developers as it was lacking UNIT Testing, now its added!

- # SleekDB class now deprecated

  Although, we are providing downwards compatibility in this version, but will remove the old SleekDB object with version 3.0.

- # Better Caching Support

  Data caching has been improved,

  - Added custom expiry of a cache file.
  - Allows query specific caching rules.
