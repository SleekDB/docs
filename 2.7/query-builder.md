# QueryBuilder

The QueryBuilder is used to **prepare more complex queries**, **`not to execute the query!`**. You can create a QueryBuilder with the `createQueryBuilder()` method of the `Store` class.

```php
$userQueryBuilder = $userStore->createQueryBuilder();
```

## getQuery() {#query-builder-getQuery}

With the `getQuery` method of the QueryBuilder class you can **`retrieve the Query object to execute the query`**.

```php
function getQuery(): Query
```

The most important methods of the Query class to execute a query are:

- # fetch()
  Retrieve multiple documents
- # first()
  Retrieve first found document
- # exists()
  Check if a document for given query exist
- # delete()
  Delete all documents that are found with given query
- # update()
  Update all documents that are found with given query

For more details on query execution please visit the <a class="gotoblock" href="/#/query">Query</a> page.

## where() {#query-builder-where}

To filter data we use the where() method of the QueryBuilder object.<br/>If you provide multiple conditions they are connected with an `AND`.

```php
function where(array $criteria): QueryBuilder
```

### Parameters

1. # $criteria
   One or multiple where conditions.<br/>
   The criteria can be nested as much as needed.

- [$fieldName, $condition, $value]
- [ [$fieldName, $condition, $value], [$fieldName, $condition, $value], ... ]
- [ [$fieldName, $condition, $value], OPERATION ,[$fieldName, $condition, $value], ... ]

  - # $fieldName: string

      The field name argument is the property that we want to check in our data object.

      As our data object is basically a JSON document so it could have nested properties.

      To target nested properties we use a single dot between the property/field name.

      **Example:** From our above users object if we want to target the "country" property of a user, then we would pass `location.country` in this argument, because "location" is the parent property of the "country" property in our data object.

  - # $condition: string

      To apply the comparison filters we use this argument.<br/>
      The condition is case insensitive.

      Allowed conditional operators are:

      - `=` Match equal against data.
      - `===` Match equal against data.
      - `==` Match equal against data. (Type unsafe comparison)
      - `!=` Match not equal against data.
      - `!==` Match not equal against data.
      - `<>` Match not equal against data. (Type unsafe comparison)
      - `>` Match greater than against data.
      - `>=` Match greater equal against data.
      - `<` Match less than against data.
      - `<=` Match less equal against data.
      - `LIKE` Match using wildcards.
      - `NOT LIKE` Match using wildcards. **Negation** of result.<br/>
        Supported wildcards:
          - `%` Represents zero or more characters<br/>
            Example: bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
          - `_` Represents a single character<br/>
            Example: h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
          - `[]` Represents any single character within the brackets<br/>
            Example: h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
          - `^` Represents any character not in the brackets<br/>
            Example: h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
          - `-` Represents a range of characters<br/>
            Example: c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
      - `IN` $value has to be an `array`. Check if data is in given list. 
      - `NOT IN` $value has to be an `array`. Check if data is **not** in given list. 
      - `BETWEEN` $value has to be an `array` with a lengeth of 2.<br/>
        Check if data is within first and second value.<br/>
        Begin and end values are included.
      - `NOT BETWEEN` $value has to be an `array` with a length of 2.<br/>
        Check if data is **not** within first and second value.<br/>
        Begin and end values are included.


  - # $value
      Data that will be checked against the property value of the JSON documents.<br/>
      Can also be a DateTime object if the property value of the JSON document is convertable into a DateTime object. Refer to the <a class="gotoblock" href="#/dates">Working with Dates</a> documentation to learn more about that.

  - # OPERATION: string
    It is used to connect multiple conditions.<br/>
    The operation is optional and can be set to `AND` or `OR`.<br/>
    Default: `AND`

### Example 1

To only get the user whose country is equal to "England" we would query like this:

```php
// inline
$users = $userStore
  ->createQueryBuilder()
  ->where( [ "name", "=", "Joshua Edwards" ] )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();

// creating the QueryBuilder
$userQueryBuilder = $userStore->createQueryBuilder();

// preparing the query with the QueryBuilder
$userQueryBuilder->where( [ "name", "=", "Joshua Edwards" ] );

// executing the query
$users = $userQueryBuilder->getQuery()->fetch();
```

### Example 2

You can also use multiple `where` conditions.

Retrieve all users that have `products.totalSaved > 10 AND products.totalBought > 20`.

```php
// inline & using where method multiple times
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where( ["products.totalSaved", ">", 10] )
  ->where( ["products.totalBought", ">", 20] )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();

// inline & using where method once
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where(
    [
      ["products.totalSaved", ">", 10],
      ["products.totalBought", ">", 20]
    ]
  )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();

// retrieve QueryBuilder
$userQueryBuilder = $userStore->createQueryBuilder()

// prepare query
$userQueryBuilder->where(
  [
    ["products.totalSaved", ">", 10],
    ["products.totalBought", ">", 20]
  ]
);

// execute query
$users = $userQueryBuilder->getQuery()->fetch();

```

### Example 3

Retrieve all users that have the status "premium", live in "london" or "new york" and are between the age of 16 and 20 or older than 30.

```sql
// example in sql
WHERE 
  status = "premium" 
  AND 
  (
    ( city = "london" OR city = "new york" )
    AND 
    ( (age >= 16 AND age < 20) OR age > 30 )
  )
```

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where(
    [
      ["status", "=", "premium"], // <-- If no operation is provided, "AND" is used.
      [ 
        [ "city", "=", "london" ], "OR", ["city", "=", "new york"] 
      ],
      "AND",
      [
        [
          [ "age", ">=", 16 ], "AND", [ "age", "<", 20 ]
        ],
        "OR",
        [ "age", ">", 30 ]
      ]
    ]
  )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

## orWhere() {#query-builder-orWhere}

`orWhere(...)` works as the OR condition of SQL. SleekDB supports multiple orWhere as object chain.<br/>If you provide multiple conditions they are connected with an `AND`.

```php
function orWhere(array $criteria): QueryBuilder
```

### Properties

1. # $criteria
   One or multiple where conditions.<br/>
   The criteria can be nested as much as needed.

- [$fieldName, $condition, $value]

    Default: `AND`

### Example 1

Retrieve all users that have `(products.totalSaved > 10 AND products.totalBought > 20) OR products.shipped = 1`

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where(
    [
      ["products.totalSaved", ">", 10],
      ["products.totalBought", ">", 20]
    ]
  )
  ->orWhere( ["products.shipped", "=", 1] )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

### Example 2

Retrieve all users that have `products.totalSaved > 10 OR (products.totalBought > 20 AND products.shipped = 1) OR totalBought = 0`

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where( ["products.totalSaved", ">", 10] )
  ->orWhere(
    [
      [ "products.totalBought", ">", 20 ],
      [ "products.shipped", "=", 1 ]
    ]
  )
  ->orWhere( ["products.totalBought", "=", 0] )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

### Example 3

Retrieve all users that have the status "premium" or live in "london" or "new york" and are between the age of 16 and 20 or older than 30.

```sql
// example in sql
WHERE 
  status = "premium" 
  OR 
  (
    ( city = "london" OR city = "new york" )
    AND 
    ( (age >= 16 AND age < 20) OR age > 30 )
  )
```

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where(["status", "=", "premium"])
  ->orWhere(
    [
      [ 
        [ "city", "=", "london" ], "OR", ["city", "=", "new york"] 
      ],
      "AND",
      [
        [
          [ "age", ">=", 16 ], // <-- If no operation is provided, "AND" is used.
          [ "age", "<", 20 ]
        ],
        "OR",
        [ "age", ">", 30 ]
      ]
    ]
  )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

## select(){#query-builder-select}

With select(...) you can specify specific fields to output, like after the SELECT keyword in SQL. SleekDB supports multiple `select()` as object chain for multiple fields.

```php
function select(array $fieldNames): QueryBuilder
```

### Parameters

1. # $fieldNames: array
  Specify specific fields to output.
  - ["fieldName1", "fieldName2", ...]
  - ["ALIAS" => "fieldName1", "fieldName2", ..]

### When using select in conjunction with <a class="gotoblock" href="#/query-builder#groupBy">groupBy</a> you can also use functions.
  - ["ALIAS" => ["FUNCTION" => "fieldName"], ...]<br/>
    Available functions:
      - `SUM`
      - `MAX`
      - `MIN`
      - `AVG`

### Example 1

Retrieve just the name of all users.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->select(['name'])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
// output: [["_id" => 1, "name" => "Max"], ["_id" => 2, "name" => "Hasan"]]
```

### Example 2

Retrieve just the age of all users as age.<br/>
**Note**: The age of the user is stored in a nested array.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->select(["age" => "userBiography.age"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
// output: [["_id" => 1, "age" => 20], ["_id" => 2, "age" => 17]]
```

### Example 3

Using a function when using <a class="gotoblock" href="#/query-builder#groupBy">groupBy</a>.

```sql
SELECT age, SUM(follower) as followerSum GROUP BY age;
```

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->select(["age", "followerSum" => ["SUM" => "follower"]])
  ->groupBy(["age"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

## except() {#query-builder-except}

`except(...)` works as the opposite of `select()` method. Use it when you don't want a property in the result. For example, if you don't want the password field in your returned data set.

```php
function except(array $fieldNames): QueryBuilder
```

1. # $fieldNames: array
   Specify specific fields to exclude from the output.

### Example 1

Retrieve all information of an user except its \_id and name.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->except(["_id", "name"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
// output: [["age" => 28], ["age" => 18]]
```

### Example 2

Retrieve all information of an user except its name and streetNumber.<br/>
**Note**: The steet number is stored in a nested array.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->except(["name", "address.streetNumber"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

#### Result
```
[ ["_id" => 2, "address" => [ "street" => "Firststreet" ]], ... ]
```


## skip() {#query-builder-skip}

Skip works as the OFFSET clause of SQL. You can use this to skip a specific amount of documents.

```php
function skip(int $skip = 0): QueryBuilder
```

### Parameters

1. # $skip: int
   The value of how many documents should be skipped.

### Example

Retrieve all users except the first 10 found.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->skip(10)
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

## limit() {#query-builder-limit}

Works as the LIMIT clause of SQL. You can use this to limit the results to a specific amount.

```php
function limit($limit = 0): QueryBuilder
```

### Parameters

1. # $limit: int
   Limit the amount of values in the result set. Has to be greater than 0.

### Example

Retrieve just the first ten users.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->limit(10)
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

## orderBy() {#query-builder-orderBy}

Works as the ORDER BY clause of SQL. With this method you can sort the result. You can use this method to sort the result by one or multiple fields.

```php
function orderBy( array $criteria): QueryBuilder
```

### Parameters

1. # $criteria: array

- [ $fieldName => $order ]
- [ $fieldName => $order, $fieldName => $order, ... ]
  - # $fieldName: string
    Name of the field that will be used to sort the result.
  - # $order: string
    Either `desc` for a descending sort or `asc` for a ascending sort.

### Example 1

Retrieve all users sorted by their name.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->orderBy(["name" => "asc"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

#### Result

```
[["_id" => 13, "name" => "Anton"], ["_id" => 2, "name" => "Berta"], ...]
```

### Example 2

Retrieve all users sorted by their name and age.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->orderBy(["name" => "asc", "age" => "asc"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

#### Result

```
[
  ["_id" => 13, "name" => "Anton", "age" => 20],
  ["_id" => 4, "name" => "Aragon", "age" => 16], 
  ["_id" => 2, "name" => "Aragon", "age" => 17], 
  ...
]
```

## groupBy() {#query-builder-groupBy}
Group documents using one or multiple fields.

```php
function groupBy(array $groupByFields, string $counterKeyName = null, bool $allowEmpty = false): QueryBuilder
```

> When using groupBy the <a class="gotoblock" href="#/query-builder#select">select</a> method has extended functionality!<br/>
> **Note**: If you use select in conjunction with groupBy you have to explicitly specify all fields you want in the result.

### Parameters

1. # $groupByFields: array
   One or multiple fields to group documents by.
2. # $counterKeyName: string
   If counterKeyName is not null a counter that represents how many documents are grouped together will be applied to the result documents automatically using the given string as the name for the counter.<br/>
   **Note**: You can not specify an alias with the <a class="gotoblock" href="#/query-builder#select">select</a> method for this new field, because it is already an alias!
3. # $allowEmpty: bool
   If true documents having an empty value like null, in the fields that are relevant for grouping, will be grouped together.

### Example 1

Group active products based on category.

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS productAmount WHERE active = true GROUP BY category;
```

```php
$productQueryBuilder
  ->where(["active", "=", true])
  ->groupBy(["category"], "productAmount")
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

#### Result

```
[ 
  ["category" => "pants", "productAmount" => 200], 
  ["category" => "shirts", "productAmount" => 29], 
  ... 
]
```

### Example 2

Group active products based on category and return the sum of the views.

```sql
SELECT 
  category AS Category,
  subcategory, 
  COUNT(*) AS productAmount,
  SUM(views) AS views 
WHERE 
  active = true 
GROUP BY 
  category, subcategory
ORDER BY
  category ASC, subcategory DESC;
```

```php
$productQueryBuilder
  ->select([ 
    "Category" => "category", 
    "subcategory", 
    "productAmount", 
    "views" => ["SUM" => "views"] 
  ])
  ->where(["active", "=", true])
  ->groupBy(
    ["category", "subcategory"],
    "productAmount"
  )
  ->orderBy(["category" => "ASC", "subcategory" => "DESC"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

#### Result

```
[ 
  ["Category" => "pants", "subcategory" => "shorts", "productAmount" => 20, "views" => 212], 
  ["Category" => "pants", "subcategory" => "jeans", "productAmount" => 83, "views" => 331], 
  ... 
]
```

## having() {#query-builder-having}

    Default: `AND`

### Example 1

Group active products based on category and just retrieve categories with views higher than 500 and lower than 1000.

```sql
SELECT 
  category, 
  SUM(views) AS totalViews
WHERE 
  active = true 
GROUP BY 
  category 
HAVING
  totalViews > 500 AND totalViews < 1000;
```

```php
$productQueryBuilder
  ->select([ "category", "totalViews" => ["SUM" => "views"] ])
  ->where(["active", "=", true])
  ->groupBy(["category"])
  ->having([ 
    ["totalViews", ">", 500], 
    "AND", // <- Optional
    ["totalViews", "<", 1000] 
  ])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

#### Result

```
[ 
  ["category" => "pants", "totalViews" => 502], 
  ["category" => "shirts", "totalViews" => 931], 
  ... 
]
```

## search() {#query-builder-search}

Do a fulltext like search against one or multiple fields.

```php
function search($fields, string $query, array $options = []): QueryBuilder
```

> Please visit the <a class="gotoblock" href="#/searching">"Searching" documentation</a> for more details and examples!

### Parameters

1. # $fields: array|string
   An array containg all fields to search against.

    * "title"
    * ["title"]
    * ["title", "content", ...]

   As our documents are basically JSON documents it also could have nested properties.

   To target nested properties we use a single dot between the property/field name.

   **Example:** `address.street`

2. # $query: string
   The search query.

3. # $options: array
   Configure the search behaviour on a query by query base.

## distinct() {#query-builder-distinct}

The distinct method is used to retrieve unique values from the store. It will remove all the duplicate documents while fetching data from a store.

```php
distinct( array|string $fields ): QueryBuilder;
```

### Parameters

1. # $fields: array|string
   Specify one or multiple fields you want to be distinct.

### Example

Retrieve all users, but just the first user if there is another one with the same name.

```php
// providing a string
$distinctUsers = $userQueryBuilder
  ->distinct("name")
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();

// providing an array
$distinctUsers = $userQueryBuilder
  ->distinct(["name"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

## Cache management {#query-builder-cache-management}

The QueryBuilder provides the `useCache`, `disableCache` and `regenerateCache` methods to manage caching on a query by query base.

Please visit the <a class="gotoblock" href="/#/cache-management">Cache Management</a> page for more details.

## join() {#query-builder-join}

This method is used to join two or multiple stores together.

For more details please visit the <a class="gotoblock" href="/#/join-stores">Join Stores</a> page.

```php
function join(Closure $joinedStore, string $dataPropertyName): QueryBuilder
```

## ~~nestedWhere()~~ {#query-builder-nestedWhere}

> ### ðŸš¨ Deprecated since version 2.3, use `where` and `orWhere` instead!

With the `nestedWhere(...)` method you are able to make complex nested where statements.

```php
function nestedWhere(array $conditions): QueryBuilder
```

### Conditions array structure
```php
[
  "OUTERMOST_OPERATION" => [
    // conditions
  ]
];
```

### Properties

1. # $conditions
   Multiple where conditions.<br/>
   The criteria can be nested as much as needed.

- Small Example:<br/>
  [ "OUTERMOST_OPERATION" => [ [$fieldName, $condition, $value], "OPERATION", [$fieldName, $condition, $value] ] ]


  - # $fieldName: string

      The field name argument is the property that we want to check in our data object.

      As our data object is basically a JSON document so it could have nested properties.

      To target nested properties we use a single dot between the property/field name.

      **Example:** From our above users object if we want to target the "country" property of a user, then we would pass `location.country` in this argument, because "location" is the parent property of the "country" property in our data object.

  - # $condition: string

      To apply the comparison filters we use this argument.
      The condition is case insensitive.

      Allowed conditional operators are:

      - `=` Match equal against data.
      - `===` Match equal against data.
      - `==` Match equal against data. (Type unsafe comparison)
      - `!=` Match not equal against data.
      - `!==` Match not equal against data.
      - `<>` Match not equal against data. (Type unsafe comparison)
      - `>` Match greater than against data.
      - `>=` Match greater equal against data.
      - `<` Match less than against data.
      - `<=` Match less equal against data.
      - `LIKE` Match using wildcards.
      - `NOT LIKE` Match using wildcards. **Negation** of result.<br/>
        Supported wildcards:
          - `%` Represents zero or more characters<br/>
            Example: bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
          - `_` Represents a single character<br/>
            Example: h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
          - `[]` Represents any single character within the brackets<br/>
            Example: h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
          - `^` Represents any character not in the brackets<br/>
            Example: h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
          - `-` Represents a range of characters<br/>
            Example: c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
      - `IN` $value has to be an `array`. Check if data is in given list. 
      - `NOT IN` $value has to be an `array`. Check if data is **not** in given list. 
      - `BETWEEN` $value has to be an `array` with a lengeth of 2.<br/>
        Check if data is within first and second value.<br/>
        Begin and end values are included.
      - `NOT BETWEEN` $value has to be an `array` with a length of 2.<br/>
        Check if data is **not** within first and second value.<br/>
        Begin and end values are included.


  - # $value
      Data that will be checked against the property value of the JSON documents.<br/>
      Can also be a DateTime object if the property value of the JSON document is convertable into a DateTime object. Refer to the <a class="gotoblock" href="#/dates">Working with Dates</a> documentation to learn more about that.

  - # OUTERMOST_OPERATION: string
    Can be set to `AND` or `OR`.<br/>
    It is **optional** and will **default** to an `AND` operation.<br/>
    The outermost operation is optional and does specify how the given conditions are connected with other conditions, like the ones that are specified using the `where`, `orWhere`, in or `notIn` methods.
  - # OPERATION: string
    Can be set to `AND` or `OR`.<br/>
    The operation is used to connect multiple conditions.

    

### Example 1

Retrieve all users whos name start with "a" or "b", that have products.totalSaved > 10 and products totalBought > 10 and are between 16 and 20 or 24 and 28 years old.

```sql
WHERE 
  (products.totalSaved > 10 AND products.totalBought > 20) 
  AND // <- Outermost Operation
  ( 
    (name like 'a%' OR name like 'b%') 
    AND 
    (
      (age >= 16 AND age < 20) 
      OR 
      (age >= 24 AND age < 28)) 
    )
```

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where(
    [
      ["products.totalSaved", ">", 10],
      ["products.totalBought", ">", 20]
    ]
  )
  ->nestedWhere(
    [
      "AND" => [ // <- Outermost operation
        [
          [ "name", "like", "a%" ], "OR", [ "name", "like", "b%" ]
        ],
        "AND",
        [
          [
            [ "age", ">=", 16 ], "AND", [ "age", "<", 20 ]
          ],
          "OR",
          [
            [ "age", ">=", 24 ], "AND", [ "age", "<", 28 ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

### Example 2

Retrieve all users that have the status "premium", live in "london" and are between the age of 16 and 20 or older than 30.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->where(
    [
      ["status", "=", "premium"]
    ]
  )
  ->nestedWhere(
    [
      [ // <- Outermost operation is optional (Default: "AND")
        [ "city", "=", "london" ]
        "AND",
        [
          [
            [ "age", ">=", 16 ], "AND", [ "age", "<", 20 ]
          ],
          "OR",
          [ "age", ">", 30 ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  )
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

### ~~in()~~ {#query-builder-in}

> ### ðŸš¨ Deprecated since version 2.3, use `where` and `orWhere` instead!

in(...) works as the IN clause of SQL. SleekDB supports multiple IN as object chain for different fields.

```php
in(string $fieldName, array $values = []): QueryBuilder
```

### Parameters

1. # $fieldName: string

   The field name argument is the property that we want to check in our data object.

   You can also provide have nested properties separated with a dot ".".

2. # $values: array

   This argument takes an array to match documents within its items.

### Examples

Retrieve all users that are from the country BD, CA, SE or NA.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->in("country", ["BD", "CA", "SE", "NA"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

Retrieve all users that are from country BD, CA, SE, NA and are at the age of 18, 20, 23 or 30.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->in("country", ["BD", "CA", "SE", "NA"])
  ->in("age", [18, 20, 23, 30])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

## ~~notIn()~~ {#query-builder-notIn}

> ### ðŸš¨ Deprecated since version 2.3, use `where` and `orWhere` instead!

notIn(...) works as the opposite of in() method.

It will filter out all documents that has particular data items from the given array.
SleekDB supports multiple notIn as object chain for different fields.

The notIn() method takes two arguments as in() method, those are:

```php
function notIn(string $fieldName, array $values = []): QueryBuilder
```

### Parameters

1. # $fieldName: string

   The field name argument is the property that we want to check in our data object.

   You can also provide have nested properties separated with a dot ".".

2. # $values: array

   This argument takes an array to match documents within its items.

### Examples

Retrieve all users that are not from the coutry IN, KE or OP.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->notIn("country", ["IN", "KE", "OP"])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```

Retrieve all users that are not from the country IN, KE or OP and do not have products.totalSaved 100, 150 or 200.

```php
$users = $userQueryBuilder
  ->notIn("country", ["IN", "KE", "OP"])
  ->notIn("products.totalSaved", [100, 150, 200])
  ->getQuery()
  ->fetch();
```
