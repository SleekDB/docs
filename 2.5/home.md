# SleekDB - A NoSQL Database made using PHP

SleekDB is a simple flat file NoSQL like database implemented in PHP without any third-party dependencies that store data in plain JSON files.

It is not designed to handle heavy-load IO operations, it is designed to have a simple solution where all we need a database for is managing a few gigabytes of data. You can think of it as a database for low to medium operation loads.

## 😎 Manage Static Data With Ease

SleekDB works great as the database engine for low to medium traffic websites. It makes simple database effortless.

## 📝 Your Dynamic Website Become Static

SleekDB will cache all query data by default, in a way that would make any dynamic site as fast as static sites.

## 🗄 Flat File Database

SleekDB is also a flat file database, but instead of a single file it stores data in multiple JSON files. That allows it to have a better concurrency support compared to fully FlatFile database systems. SleekDB can be compared with other flat file database systems because the final query output will be cached and later reused from a single file instead of traversing all the available files.

## 🥳 You Are Not Alone!

SleekDB is being used with many websites and applications which are in production right now. The core team consists of two developers. They actively maintain, contribute to, and develop the SleekDB Database.
