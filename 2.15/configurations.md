# Configurations

SleekDB allows a few configuration options, which are

- <a class="gotoblock" href="#/configurations#auto_cache">auto_cache</a>
- <a class="gotoblock" href="#/configurations#cache_lifetime">cache_lifetime</a>
- ~~<a class="gotoblock" href="#/configurations#timeout">timeout</a>~~ <br/>
  ( ðŸš¨ Deprecated since version 2.12, set it to `false` and if needed use <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set_time_limit()</a> in your own code! )
- <a class="gotoblock" href="#/configurations#primary_key">primary_key</a>
- <a class="gotoblock" href="#/configurations#search">search</a>
- <a class="gotoblock" href="#/configurations#folder_permissions">folder_permissions</a>

They are store wide, which means they will be used on every query, if not changed on a query by query base.

## Using Custom Configuration

You can pass the configurations array as a third parameter when initializing the Store object:

```php
// default configurations
$configuration = [
  "auto_cache" => true,
  "cache_lifetime" => null,
  "timeout" => 120, // deprecated! Set it to false!
  "primary_key" => "_id",
  "search" => [
    "min_length" => 2,
    "mode" => "or",
    "score_key" => "scoreKey",
    "algorithm" => Query::SEARCH_ALGORITHM["hits"]
  ],
  "folder_permissions" => 0777
];
$newsStore = new \SleekDB\Store("news", $dataDir, $configuration);
```

Let's get familiar with the available configuration options.

## auto_cache {#configurations-auto_cache}

The `auto_cache` is set to `true` by default!

This tells SleekDB to use the build in caching system.

To disable build in caching set `auto_cache` to `false` in the config array.

Note that you can manually manage caching on a query by query base with methods that SleekDB provides.
Available caching method's are:

- `QueryBuilder->regenerateCache()`
- `QueryBuilder->useCache()`
- `QueryBuilder->disableCache()`

## cache_lifetime {#configurations-cache_lifetime}

The `cache_lifetime` is set to `null` by default!

Can be an `int >= 0`, that specifies the lifetime in seconds, or `null` to define that there is no lifetime.

This specifies the default cache time to live store wide.

If set to null the cache files made with that store instance will have no lifetime and will be regenerated on every insert/update/delete operation.

> `0` means infinite lifetime.

Note that you can specify the cache lifetime on a query by query base by using the useCache method of the QueryBuilder and pass a lifetime.

- `QueryBuilder->useCache($lifetime)`

## timeout {#configurations-timeout}

> ### ðŸš¨ Deprecated since version 2.12, set it to `false` and if needed use <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set_time_limit()</a> in your own code!

Set timeout value. Default value is `120` seconds.
It uses the build in php <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set_time_limit()</a> function.<br/>
You can set the timeout option to `false` if you do not want to use or can not use set_time_limit.

## primary_key {#configurations-primary_key}

Set the primary key into any string you want.<br/>
SleekDB will then use that key instead of the default `_id` key.

## search {#configurations-search}

On this documentation page we will provide you a brief description regarding the configuration options.

> Note: You will find more on searching at <a class="gotoblock" href="#/searching">Searching</a>

### min_length

It has to be an `integer` > 0.<br/>
The minimum length of a word within the search query that will be used for searching.

### mode

Has to be a `string`.<br/>
SleekDB provides two modes.

- "or" 
- "and"

### score_key

Can be a `string` or `null`.<br/>
If this configuration is `null` no field containing the score will be applied to the documents.<br/>
If it is a `string` a new field with the specified field name will be applied to every document, which will contain the search score and can be used to for example sort the documents.


### algorithm

SleekDB provides 4 search algorithms. `hits`, `hits_prioritize`, `prioritize`, `prioritize_position`<br/>
These algorithms change the score generation.<br/>
They are available as a **constant of the `Query` class**.

Example:
```php
Query::SEARCH_ALGORITHM["hits"] // default
```

## folder_permissions {#configurations-folder_permissions}

`folder_permissions` is set to `0777` by default!

It has to be a valid `int`. Refer to the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.chmod.php" target="_blank">official documentation</a> to learn more about permissions.

The given permission is **only used when creating a new folder**. For example when creating a new store, that does not already exist.
